    <h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
    <p>This chicken enchilada casserole recipe is so good that my four picky kids eat it â€” and I got my picture in the paper for it! If you want to skip the charring step, simply tear the tortillas into quarters so they absorb the sauce better.</p>
    <h1>INGRIDIENT</h1>
    <ul>

        <li>4 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves</li>
        <li>garlic salt to taste</li>
        <li>18 (6 inch) corn tortillas, torn in half</li>
        <li>1 (8 ounce) container reduced fat sour cream</li>
        
    </ul>
    <h1>Steps</h1>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Butter a 9x13-inch baking dish.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, char each tortilla half over the open flame of a gas stove burner using metal tongs until lightly puffed, about 1 minute.</li>
        <li>Cover and bake in the preheated oven for 45 minutes. Cool slightly before serving.</li>
        <li>Season chicken with garlic salt; arrange in the prepared baking dish. Bake in the preheated oven until no longer pink and juices run clear, about 45 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Cool, shred, and set aside.</li>
    </ol>
